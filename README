asparser converts ActionScript3 sources into C#.

asparser is an experimental hack for my own purpose.
It does not aim to become a useful conversion tool for everyone.
It will lack a lot of required features.

asparser uses Irony parser framework, which is available at:
http://irony.codeplex.com/

There is a lot of limitation and I don't give high priority to fix them. I rather modify sources files whenever easier.

Some known issues:

	- Semicolons are *required* at end of line (they are optional in AS3).
	- Concatenation of generic operator and let operator conflicts with
	  less-equal operator: foo.<bar>=1 must be rewritten to foo.<bar> = 1
	- Multiple imports of a type results in errors, as I use "using x = y;"
	  and multiple mapping to the same alias is prohibited.
	- Some operators are not converted correctly: ===, !==, >>>, <<<
	  (grep around the sources files to find out how they are converted.)
